# Human-Trafficking-Data-Analysis
## Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset on human trafficking to uncover patterns, trends, and insights into this global issue. By leveraging data science techniques, we explore key aspects such as victim demographics, types of exploitation, and geographic distributions. The goal is to provide meaningful visualizations and statistics to raise awareness and support further research or policy-making efforts.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data for reliable analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summarizes victim age groups, exploitation types, and citizenship patterns.
- **Visualizations:** Includes interactive pie charts and heatmaps to illustrate findings effectively.
- **Geographic Mapping:** Converts country codes to names and visualizes victim distributions globally.
- **Custom Analysis:** Breaks down exploitation types by age groups with styled tables.

## Dataset
The dataset ([Global Human Trafficking Dataset](https://www.ctdatacollaborative.org/page/global-dataset?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) contains 48,801 records with 63 columns, including:

- **yearOfRegistration:** Year the case was registered (2002–2019).
- **gender, ageBroad:** Demographic details of victims.
- **citizenship:** Country of origin (ISO Alpha-2 codes).
- **typeOfExploitConcatenated:** Types of exploitation (e.g., sexual exploitation, forced labor).
- **RecruiterRelationship:** Relationship of the recruiter to the victim.

Note: Sensitive or incomplete columns were dropped to ensure meaningful insights.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3.9+**
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and cleaning.
- **NumPy:** Numerical operations.
- **Seaborn:** Heatmap visualizations.
- **Plotly:** Interactive charts (e.g., pie charts for exploitation types).
- **pycountry_convert:** Country code conversions.

## Installation
### Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-trafficking-analysis.git
cd human-trafficking-analysis
```
### Install Dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Requirements File (create `requirements.txt`):
```
pandas
numpy
seaborn
plotly
pycountry_convert
```

### Run the Notebook:
- Open `human_trafficking_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible IDE.
- Ensure `human_trafficking.csv` is in the project directory.

## Usage
- **Data Preprocessing:** Execute cells 1–11 to clean the data (remove duplicates, handle missing values, etc.).
- **Geographic Analysis:** Run cells 12–13 to map victim citizenships.
- **Visualizations:**
  - Cell 14: Pie chart of sexual exploitation types.
  - Cell 29: Heatmap of exploitation types by age group.
- **Explore Results:** Interact with the outputs or modify the code for custom analyses.

## Key Findings
### **Sexual Exploitation:**
- Dominates across age groups, peaking at ages 9–17 (1,224 cases) and 18–20 (1,022 cases).
- Pie chart shows "Prostitution" as the most common type (2119 cases), with "unknown" types significant (5644 cases).

### **Forced Labor:**
- Highest among 30–38 age group (575 cases), followed by 39–47 (320 cases).
- Less prevalent among younger victims (e.g., 37 cases for 0–8).

### **Age Distribution:**
- Victims aged 9–17 and 18–20 are most affected by sexual exploitation.
- Older age groups (30–47) face higher rates of forced labor.

### **Geographic Insights:**
- Citizenship data mapped to countries reveals global patterns (e.g., "CO" = Colombia).

## Visualizations
### **Distribution of Sexual Exploitation Types**
- Interactive pie chart showing breakdown of sexual exploitation types.

### **Exploitation Types by Age Group**
- Heatmap highlighting exploitation prevalence across age ranges.

## Future Enhancements
- Add time-series analysis for trends over years.
- Incorporate more detailed geographic visualizations (e.g., choropleth maps).
- Expand to include recruiter relationship patterns.
- Integrate machine learning for predictive insights.
